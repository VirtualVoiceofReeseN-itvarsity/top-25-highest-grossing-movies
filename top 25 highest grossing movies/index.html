    <h1>The Top 25 Grossing Movies from the early 1900's</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Movies generate revenue through various channels, such as theatrical exhibition,
        home video sales, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. <br/>
        Among these, theatrical box-office earnings serve as 
        the primary benchmark for assessing a film's success in trade publications. <br/>
        This is largely due to the availability of data in comparison to figures for home video and 
        broadcast rights, as well as historical conventions.
        <br/>
        <br/>


        While war films, musicals, and historical dramas have traditionally been popular genres,
        franchise films have emerged as some of the highest performers <br/>in the 21st century. 
        The superhero genre, in particular, has garnered significant attention,
        with ten Marvel Cinematic Universe films ranking among the top earners. <br/>
        The most successful superhero film, Avengers: Endgame, holds the second-highest position on the 
        nominal earnings chart, <br/>and four films based on Avengers comic books are among the top twenty.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        
        Although some older films that once held records for highest grosses still maintain 
        respectable earnings by today's standards, <br/>they no longer compete numerically with current top earners,
         especially in an era of higher individual ticket prices. <br/>However, when adjusted for inflation, 
         Gone with the Wind, which held the highest-grossing film title for twenty-five years, 
         remains the all-time highest-grossing film. <br/>
         All grosses in the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, unless otherwise stated.
